    "#Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "#ANS:A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, management, and manipulation of data. Databases are used to store and manage large volumes of information, making them a fundamental component of modern software applications and systems. \n",

    "#SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Data Structure: SQL databases are relational databases, which means they use tables with a predefined schema to store structured data. Data in SQL databases is typically organized into rows and columns, and each table has a fixed schema that defines the data types and relationships between tables.\n",

    "#Query Language: NoSQL databases often have their own query languages, which may be less expressive than SQL. Querying in NoSQL databases is typically optimized for specific data models."

    "#Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "#ANS:**Primary Key:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#A primary key is a database constraint that enforces the uniqueness and integrity of values in a specific column or set of columns within a database table. Here are key points about primary keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "#1. **Uniqueness:** A primary key ensures that each value in the designated column(s) is unique across all rows in the table. This uniqueness constraint prevents duplicate or repeated data in the primary key column(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. **Uniquely Identifies Rows:** A primary key uniquely identifies each row in the table. This means that no two rows can have the same combination of values in the primary key column(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "#3. **Required:** In most database systems, primary keys are required for every table. Each table should have at least one primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "#4. **Data Integrity:** Primary keys help maintain data integrity by preventing the insertion of duplicate or null values in the designated column(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "#5. **Indexing:** Primary keys are typically indexed automatically by the database system, which improves query performance when searching for rows based on the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "#6. **Examples:** Common examples of primary keys include unique identifiers like social security numbers, email addresses, or auto-incremented numeric values generated by the database system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#**Foreign Key:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#A foreign key is a database constraint that establishes a link between two tables in a relational database. It defines a relationship between the data in one table (the \"child\" table) and the data in another table (the \"parent\" table). Here are key points about foreign keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "#1. **Referential Integrity:** The primary purpose of a foreign key is to enforce referential integrity, ensuring that relationships between tables are maintained accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. **Links Tables:** A foreign key in the child table references the primary key in the parent table. This linkage is established by specifying the relationship between columns in both tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#3. **Cascading Actions:** Foreign keys can define cascading actions, such as ON DELETE and ON UPDATE. These actions dictate what happens in the child table when a related record in the parent table is modified or deleted. Common options include CASCADE (child records are also deleted or updated), SET NULL (child records' foreign key values are set to NULL), and NO ACTION (no action is taken, and an error may occur).\n",
    "\n",
    "#4. **Maintains Data Consistency:** Foreign keys help maintain data consistency by ensuring that references to related data in other tables are valid and accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#5. **Examples:** For instance, in a database for an e-commerce website, the \"Orders\" table may have a foreign key column that references the \"Customers\" table's primary key. This establishes a link between customer data and orders, ensuring that an order is associated with a valid customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#In summary, primary keys ensure uniqueness and integrity within a single table, while foreign keys establish relationships between tables, enforcing referential integrity and maintaining consistency in the database. Together, they play a crucial role in defining and maintaining the structure and relationships of a relational database."

    "#   - The `cursor()` method is used to create a cursor object, which is a Python object that allows you to interact with the MySQL database.\n",
    "#   - A cursor is like a pointer or a handle that you use to execute SQL queries, fetch data, and manage transactions.\n",
    "#   - You create a cursor by calling `connection.cursor()` on your MySQL database connection, where `connection` is the connection object created with your database credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. **`execute()` Method:**\n",
    "#   - The `execute()` method is used to execute SQL queries and statements using the cursor.\n",
    "#   - You pass the SQL query or statement as a parameter to the `execute()` method, and the cursor sends the query to the MySQL server for execution.\n",
    "#   - The method can be used for SELECT queries to retrieve data or for other SQL statements like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or CREATE TABLE.\n",
    " #  - After executing a query, you can use cursor methods like `fetchall()`, `fetchone()`, or `fetchmany()` to retrieve the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#In the example above, we first create a cursor using `cursor = connection.cursor()`, and then we execute a SELECT query using `cursor.execute(query)`. After executing the query, we fetch and print the results using a loop. Finally, we close the cursor and the database connection when we're done with them to release resources and maintain proper database connection management."
