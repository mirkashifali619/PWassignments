    "#Q4. What is ‘DataFrame’ in pandas and how is it different from pandas.series? Explain with an example.\n",
    "#ANS:\n",
    "#In pandas, a DataFrame is a two-dimensional, size-mutable, and potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure. It is one of the most commonly used data structures in pandas and is similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table. DataFrames are used to store and manipulate data in a structured way, making them a powerful tool for data analysis and manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Here are some key characteristics of a DataFrame:\n",
    "\n",
    "#1. Two-Dimensional: A DataFrame is organized as a two-dimensional table with rows and columns. Rows represent individual observations or records, while columns represent different variables or attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. Size-Mutable: You can add or remove rows and columns from a DataFrame after it's created. This makes it flexible for data manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#3. Heterogeneous Data: DataFrames can store data of different types (e.g., integers, floats, strings) in different columns, making them suitable for handling real-world datasets with mixed data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "#On the other hand, a pandas Series is a one-dimensional array-like object that can hold data of any type. A Series is essentially a single column from a DataFrame. Each element in a Series has an associated label called an index. Series can be thought of as a special case of a DataFrame where you have only one column.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Let's illustrate the difference between a DataFrame and a Series with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "#```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a DataFrame\n",
    "data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],\n",
    "        'Age': [25, 30, 35],\n",
    "        'City': ['New York', 'San Francisco', 'Los Angeles']}\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "# df is now a DataFrame with three columns: 'Name', 'Age', and 'City'\n",
    "print(df)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a Series from the 'Age' column of the DataFrame\n",
    "age_series = df['Age']\n",
    "\n",
    "# age_series is a Series containing the ages of individuals\n",
    "print(age_series)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing a specific element in the DataFrame\n",

    "\n",
    "# Accessing a specific element in the Series\n",
    "print(age_series[1])  # Accessing the age of the second person\n",
    "#```\n",
    "\n",
    "#In this example, `df` is a DataFrame containing information about individuals, including their names, ages, and cities. `age_series` is a Series created from the 'Age' column of the DataFrame. While both DataFrame and Series can store and manipulate data, the key difference is in their dimensionality and how they are accessed. DataFrames are two-dimensional, and you can access data by both row and column labels, while Series are one-dimensional and have a single column of data with associated index labels."

    "#you give an example of when you might use one of these functions?\n",
    "#ANS:\n",
    "#Pandas provides a wide range of functions for manipulating data in a DataFrame. Here are some common functions and methods that are frequently used:\n",
    "\n",
    "#1. **Selection and Filtering**:\n",
    "#   - `loc[]` and `iloc[]`: Used to select specific rows and columns by labels or integer location.\n",
    "#   - `query()`: Allows you to filter DataFrame rows using a query expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   Example:\n",
    "#   ```python\n",
    "#   # Select rows with Age greater than 30\n",
    "#   df_filtered = df[df['Age'] > 30]\n",
    "#   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. **Sorting**:\n",
    "#   - `sort_values()`: Sorts the DataFrame by one or more columns.\n",
    "\n",
    " #  Example:\n",
    " #  ```python\n",
    " #  # Sort DataFrame by 'Age' column in descending order\n",
    "#   df_sorted = df.sort_values(by='Age', ascending=False)\n",
    " #  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#3. **Aggregation**:\n",
    " #  - `groupby()`: Groups data based on one or more columns and allows you to perform aggregate operations (e.g., sum, mean, count) on groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   Example:\n",
    " #  ```python\n",
    " #  # Group data by 'City' and calculate the average age in each city\n",
    " #  city_avg_age = df.groupby('City')['Age'].mean()\n",
    "#   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#4. **Joining and Merging**:\n",
    "#   - `merge()`: Combines two or more DataFrames based on a common column or index.\n",
    "\n",
    " #  Example:\n",
    " #  ```python\n",
    " #  # Merge two DataFrames based on a common 'ID' column\n",
    " #  merged_df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='ID')\n",
    " #  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#5. **Data Cleaning**:\n",
    "#   - `drop()`: Removes specified rows or columns from the DataFrame.\n",
    "#   - `fillna()`: Fills missing values with a specified value or using various filling strategies.\n",
    "   \n",
    "#   Example:\n",
    " #  ```python\n",
    "#   # Drop rows with missing values in the 'Age' column\n",
    "#   df_cleaned = df.dropna(subset=['Age'])\n",
    " #  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#6. **Adding and Modifying Columns**:\n",
    "#   - Assigning values to a new or existing column.\n",
    "\n",
    " #  Example:\n",
    "#   ```python\n",
    "#   # Adding a new column 'BirthYear' based on the 'Age' column\n",
    " #  df['BirthYear'] = 2023 - df['Age']\n",
    " #  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#7. **Pivot Tables**:\n",
    " #  - `pivot_table()`: Creates a pivot table from the data, allowing you to summarize and reshape it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   Example:\n",
    "#   ```python\n",
    " #  # Create a pivot table to summarize data by 'City' and 'Gender'\n",
    " #  pivot_table = df.pivot_table(index='City', columns='Gender', values='Age', aggfunc='mean')\n",
    "  # ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#8. **Handling DateTime Data**:\n",
    "#   - `to_datetime()`: Converts a column to datetime format.\n",
    "#   - `dt` accessor: Allows you to extract components like year, month, day from datetime columns.\n",
    "\n",
    " #  Example:\n",
    " #  ```python\n",
    " #  # Convert a column 'DateOfBirth' to datetime format\n",
    " #  df['DateOfBirth'] = pd.to_datetime(df['DateOfBirth'])\n",
    "  # # Extract the year from the 'DateOfBirth' column\n",
    "  # df['YearOfBirth'] = df['DateOfBirth'].dt.year\n",
